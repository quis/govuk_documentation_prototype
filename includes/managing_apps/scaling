<p>The Cloud Foundry technology makes it easy to scale your application to meet increasing demand. Scaling does not happen automatically; you have to use the commands described below.</p>

<p>Note that the maximum resources you can use will be limited by your organization quotas. You can view them by running:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">cf quotas</code></p>

<p>from the command line.</p>

<p>If you are anticipating a spike in demand for a service hosted on the Government PaaS, please contact us well in advance at <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="increasing-instances">Increasing instances</h3>

<p>You can change the number of instances of your app running in parallel.
Incoming requests are automatically load-balanced across all instances.</p>

<p>For example, this command sets the number of running instances to five:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">cf scale APPNAME -i 5</code></p>

<p>For a production app, you should always have at least two running instances.</p>

<h3 id="increasing-memory-and-disk-space">Increasing memory and disk space</h3>

<p>You can scale an application vertically by increasing the memory or disk space available to each instance of the app.</p>

<p>For example, this command increases the available memory for an app to 1 gigabyte:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">cf scale APPNAME -m 1G</code></p>

<p>This command increases the disc space limit for an app to 512 megabytes:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">cf scale myApp -k 512M</code></p>
