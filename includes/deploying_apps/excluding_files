<h2 id="excluding-files">Excluding files</h2>

<p>Cloud Foundry isn&rsquo;t version-control aware, so <code class="prettyprint">cf push</code> will deploy the working state of whatever files you have in that directory. In most cases, you will want to <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/prepare-to-deploy.html#exclude">exclude files</a> ignored by Git. From within your project directory, run:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>ln -s .gitignore .cfignore
</code></pre>

<p>and commit the <code class="prettyprint">.cfignore</code> file to your repository. </p>

<p>If you have a more advanced CF setup, bear in mind these points about <code class="prettyprint">.cfignore</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have a more advanced app setup and have apps with a <code class="prettyprint">path</code> other than the project root (where you run <code class="prettyprint">cf push</code> from), you will need an additional <code class="prettyprint">.cfignore</code> file located in each app <code class="prettyprint">path</code>;</p></li>
<li><p>Also note that more advanced <code class="prettyprint">.gitignore</code> syntax, such as the <code class="prettyprint">**</code> recursive subdirectory wildcard, are <em>not</em> supported by <code class="prettyprint">.cfignore</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
