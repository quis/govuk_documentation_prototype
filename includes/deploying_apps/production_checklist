<h2 id="production-checklist">Production checklist</h2>

<p>Before deploying an app for production use, check the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>If your app uses a PostgreSQL service, make sure that you have selected the high-availability plan (<code class="prettyprint">M-HA-dedicated-9.5</code>) for the bound <code class="prettyprint">postgres</code> service instance.</li>
<li>You are running at least two instances of the app to ensure availability. Use <code class="prettyprint">cf scale APPNAME -i 2</code> to add an extra running instance.</li>
<li>You are prepared to use a <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html">blue-green deployment process</a> for when the app needs to be updated or restarted (this avoids problems due to a known issue with the PaaS that can generate transient 404 errors).</li>
</ol>
