<h1 id="government-paas">Government PaaS</h1>

<p>Government PaaS is a cloud-hosting platform being built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you don’t need to hire specialist cloud skills to do so.</p>

<p>Government PaaS is currently in private beta.</p>

<p>If you’d like to be one of the early applications going live on the platform, please contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>. There is limited availability for these early applications.</p>
